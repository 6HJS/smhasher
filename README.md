SMHasher is a test suite designed to test the distribution, collision, and performance properties of non-cryptographic hash functions.

1/8/2016 - I've copy-pasted the wiki pages from code.google.com/p/smasher to the wiki here and will replace the content at the old site with a link to this repo. This page should now be considered to be the official home of SMHasher & MurmurHash.
